/**
 * Scoped event bus is an extension of JavaScript's `EventTarget`.
 *
 * It implements the same `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods and allows setting listeners for events
 * originating from specific _scopes_ of the application. Such scoped event listeners will additionally include the
 * name of the event _subscriber_, an identifier of the object or script the listener belongs to. Listeners can be
 * matched against a subscriber's name for mass removal.
 *
 * In addition to the `scope` and `subscriber` properties, the ScopedEventBus also supports adding separate listeners
 * for _before_ and _after_ an event occurs. Obviously, not all event emitters are required support this feature.\
 * Broadcasting events _before_ they happen allows other parts of the application to prevent the event from carrying
 * out by calling the `preventDefault()` method (may be useful e.g. for checking complex requirements).
 *
 * Although the name of this package is **scoped** event bus, the scope of an event is always optional; if no scope
 * is declared, the event is treated as a custom event by the inherited EventTarget.

    /**
     * Appends an event listener for events whose type attribute value is `type`. The callback argument sets the
     * `callback` that will be invoked when the event is dispatched.
     *
     * The `options` argument sets listener-specific options. For compatibility this can be a boolean, in which case
     * the method behaves exactly as if the value was specified as `options`'s capture.
     *
     * When set to true, `options`'s capture prevents `callback` from being invoked when the event's eventPhase
     * attribute value is `BUBBLING_PHASE`. When false (or not present), `callback` will not be invoked when event's
     * eventPhase attribute value is `CAPTURING_PHASE`. Either way, `callback` will be invoked if event's eventPhase
     * attribute value is `AT_TARGET`.
     *
     * When set to true, `options`'s passive indicates that the `callback` will not cancel the event by invoking
     * `preventDefault()`. This is used to enable performance optimizations described in ยง 2.8 Observing event
     * listeners.
     *
     * When set to true, `options`'s once indicates that the `callback` will only be invoked once after which the event
     * listener will be removed.
     *
     * For a **scoped** event listener, the `options` object must include the name of the `subscriber` and optionally
     * the event `phase` when the callback should be fired (default is _after_):
     * `{ subscriber: string, phase?: 'before' | 'after' }`.
     *
     * If an AbortSignal is passed for `options`'s signal, then the event listener will be removed when signal is
     * aborted.
     *
     * The event listener is appended to target's event listener list and is not appended if it has the same type,
     * callback, and capture.
     * @param type - Type (name) of the event.
     * @param callback - Method to call when the event occurs.
